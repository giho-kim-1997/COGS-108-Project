    "Many people probably have heard about the “World Cup”, the most popular international sport (soccer) competition that is held every four years. Many people are fascinated by the play of famous soccer players such as Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo who show fantastic soccer skills and are regarded as gifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The famous soccer video game, EA sports’ FIFA series, provides players’ bio-information and attributes such as heights, weights, stats of cross, dribble, running speed, etc. Some critics argue that soccer players should be talented biologically. For example, a goalkeeper has to be tall so that they can block more easily. In our study, we are going to analyze the relationship between players' bio-information and performance."

    "A similar study was conducted to find out the age of Olympic athletes that give the highest performance. [The 2016 research from Exercise Physiology Laboratory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312632883_Age_of_peak_performance_in_Olympic_sports_A_comparative_research_among_disciplines) measured the performance of 3548 athletes from various types of sports. The result of the study indicated that mostly younger athletes had higher performance than older athletes. Since the range of athletes’ age was 14.0 to 52.8 and the age of athletes who recorded high performance was mostly middle of the ’20s, the study proved that younger athletes have higher performance than older athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Another research conducted in 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268996/) agrees with the study stated above. The study was to find out the effects of age on soccer players’ performance. They separated soccer players into 5 age groups: (<20 years, 20-24.9 years, 25-29.9 years, 30-34.9 years, and ≥35 years). The result of the study showed that older players’ performance is significantly less than the performance of younger players. For example, total distance, medium-speed running distance, high-speed running (HSR) distance, very HSR (VHSR) distance, sprint distance, and maximum running speed of older players were less than those of younger players. Therefore, the study indicated that younger soccer players have higher performance than older soccer players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although two researches show a strong relationship between the age of soccer players and their performance, they only consider a factor: age. It is true that researches stated above help answering our group’s question, but they do not directly answer our question. We also want to find out whether the height and weight of players affect players’ playing performance."
