# COGS 108 Group 11

Template notebooks for each component are provided.
Only work on the notebook prior to its due date.
After each submission is due, move onto the next notebook (For example, after the proposal is due, start working in the Data Checkpoint notebook).

This repository will be frozen on the final project due date. No further changes can be made after that time.

Your project proposal and final project will be graded based solely on the corresponding project notebooks in this repository.

Template Jupyter notebooks have been included, with your group number replacing the XXX in the following file names.
For each due date, make sure you have a notebook present in this repository by each due date with the following name:

* `ProjectProposal_groupXXX.ipynb`
* `DataCheckpoint_groupXXX.ipynb`
* `EDACheckpoint_groupXXX.ipynb`
* `FinalProject_groupXXX.ipynb`

This is *your* repo. You are free to manage the repo as you see fit, edit this README, add data files, add scripts, etc. So long as there are the four files above on due dates with the required information, the rest is up to you all.
